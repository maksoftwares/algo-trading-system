# EURUSD regime specialists v1

This package tests the Gold-style trajectory on EURUSD: causal market regimes, exclusive specialist ownership, and a portfolio composed only from specialists that survive frozen chronological and cost gates.

Two outcome-locked experiments were run:

1. M30-only seed: stopped before P&L because its opportunity census failed.
2. M15/M30 two-clock ensemble: passed capacity, but every specialist failed admission after exact-cost backtesting.
3. A 1.50R/12-hour asymmetric exit: realized payoff reached 1.428 overall and 1.454 in the latest six months, but full-history win rate was only 38.75% and PF was 0.904.

Final status: `RESEARCH_FAILURE_NOT_DEMO_READY`.
